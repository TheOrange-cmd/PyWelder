Dear members,

The KNKF calendar has been updated recently. See below for all announced competitions within the next 6 months!
Note: If you have already signed up for one of these competitions in an earlier form, you don't need to do that again. 
The early signup deadline is the official opening date for the signup with the KNKF. The rule is that they open signup 60 days before the competition.
However, this is often not the case. Either way, it is recommended to signup and pay before this date if possible.

Please click the link below for the signup form.

Kind regards, 

Your secretary.

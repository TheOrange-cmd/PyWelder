Please fill in the requested information below if you want Ijzersterk to sign you up for the given competitions. We can sign our members up a bit sooner than people who are not connected to an association, which is why it's a good idea to do this.

Note that the competition fee is €20.00 if your student status has been confirmed in your KNKF account. Check if this is true, and transfer this amount to the following account:

NL35 RABO 0314 2391 70 by name of DSKV IJzersterk. Include your name and which competition(s) you are paying for in the description.

If your student status is not confirmed (or you're not a student), the competition fee is €30. For more info on this, view the following link:
https://knkf-sectiepowerliften.nl/leden/studentenstatus/

For some competitions, this status is required for participation.

The KNKF tries to send out invitations 2 months before the competition, so if you want to be sure you can be signed up as soon as possible, I recommend to send the payment before then.

You will be signed up only after you have paid the fee! 

Some competitions require a qualification total for entry. For more information on this, view the following link:

Note: If you wish to enter a different weightclass or nomination entry for different competitions, just answer the form twice. Your response won't be overwritten.
